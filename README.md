# AOS
An operating system written in 8086 16 bit assembly, hence the name. Once finished, it will feature a user shell, floppy disk and hard drive management, "custom" filesystem, custom interrupts/functions, and more. Written in 8086 assembly, the code should be able to run in every CPU supporting 16 bit instructions, since the Intel 8086 released in 1978.
